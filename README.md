description: A introduction into The Onionz Project (TOP)

# 👋 Welcome to The Onionz Project Documentation

## Summary

The Onionz Project is an initiative to enable, guide, and protect the users of [_The Tor Project_](https://www.torproject.org/). We \(I\) want to make Tor as functional, powerful, and accessible as possible, while still supporting and enforcing it's core principals.

Many people can make a website. Many people can make an API. Many people can set up a web service. But very few people can successfully do this in such a restrictive environment. _**TOP**_ is there to change this. We are unlocking Tor for everyone. So get coding!

## Background

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Everything \(without exception\) from The Null Network is free.** Beware of imposters looking for payment, because we never will. If you wish, you can support us by donating to [Dasho on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/d-a-s-h-o). 
{% endhint %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="😐 Dasho" %}
I am Dasho. I am an amateur developer working with The Null Network. My job is to innovate, create, and fix platforms specifically with Tor in mind. My two primary projects to date are the Chatter Box and my Hosting solution. Many people are afraid to or don't know how to, host a website on tor \(and sometimes clearnet also\). I make this easy to do, and completely risk-free.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="📁 The Null Network" %}
The Null Network is a network of developers who build and promote open-source software. We believe in freedom of speech, the right to anonymity, and the right to safety online. We promote these and actively encourage others to join the already massive community of open source contributers. Run by D, formaly DNK, and co-run by Dasho, formaly Curious, and Nemo. 
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

_**TOP**_ is run as a revamp of the Do-Not-Know Project.

> DNK was a web-project designed to make the web more accessible to everyone, while respecting their privacy and financial restrictions. Every thing that DNK provides was **FREE** and allows for **complete anonymity**, although you do need to smart about that yourself. DNK could have been self-hosted for added privacy, and it’s package got larger every day. \(Or week, or month, or year\).

The sam still applies to _**TOP**_, and everything as shown in the warning above is free. People have posed as us before, seeking money for services that they then didn't deliver. They cheated people out of money, and also damaged our reputation \(though we don't have one\).
