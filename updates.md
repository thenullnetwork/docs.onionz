## 1.0.0 Init

01/02/2021

### Compiled existing projects into one.

* **Dashed Databases:** The database systems used for Dashed Hosting and Code Curiosity. Uses [phpmyadmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) and [adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) to provide two graphical database managers, compatible with both script and [noscript](https://noscript.net/) browsers.
* **Code Curiosity:** A self-hosted [gitbucket](https://gitbucket.github.io/) instance to provide a GitHub alternative configured to be used without restriction. Available as a tor hidden service.
* **Dashed Hosting:** A [docker](https://www.docker.com/) based VPS hosting solution which creates a ridiculously easy web server that serves over Tor by default. All preconfigured so that it is quick and simple. Only available as a tor hidden service.
* **Chatterbox:** A heavily styled alternative to the bareness of [Dan's PHP L.E-chat](https://github.com/DanWin/le-chat-php). Fully Tor compatible and easy to set up. Comes with a bunch of extra features and a much cleaner UI. Available as a tor hidden service.
* **Send Curiosity:** A file host and pastebin only available as a tor hidden service and based off [Linx](https://github.com/andreimarcu/linx-server). Has password protection, filename randomiser, and APIs available.
* **The Internet Secret:** A homemade guide to using [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/) and safely browsing Tor.
